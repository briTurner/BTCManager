Purpose of this project:
    This library will allow you to quickly design a controller on the iphone or ipad, which will be able to control a game on a different ipad or iphone. This could be used to allow the ipad/iphone running the game to be across the room plugged into the tv, while the user sits on the couch with a different iphone/ipod/ipad controlling the game.  this controller will also allow for multi player.  for instance, you could have one central game board on an ipad, while 4 other players user their iphone's/ipods to control their character on the shared bored. 

    As of right now, the library supports:
        multiple simultaneous controller connections
        joystick movements from any number of joysticks per player
        button presses from any number of buttons per player
            each button press sends a unique identifier when the button is pressed down, and then again when released
        sending of any arbitrary NSData object, which will be marked with an identifier in order to ensure to can be correctly identified and handled once the game receives it
        sending of a vibrate command to the controllers (for example, in the event that player 1 shot player 2, the game could command player 2's controller to vibrate. 




USE:
IMPORTANT:
    before you can use this library in your project you MUST add the frameworks GameKit and AudioToolbox to the project.  
    GameKit is used for assistance with connection and data transfer. 
    AudioToolbox is used to allow for the vibration commands to function


How To:
   use sharedManager: to get the singleton instance of the BTCManager
   call one of the two available configureManagerAs**** methods in order to configure your game or controller. 
        each of those methods comes with a block method which MUST be handled in order for a connection to be established
   you must then call startSession for both the controller and the game. 


keep in mind, you need to create a controller to send the commands, and a server to receive the commands.  You can wrap this all into a single universal app if you would like.  However, i would recommend making a dedicated controller app. 


the BTCManager.h file is fairly well documented.  Please refer to that, and the example projects.
