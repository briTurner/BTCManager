USE:
IMPORTANT:
    before you can use this library in your project you MUST add the frameworks GameKit and AudioToolbox to the project.  
    GameKit is used for assistance with connection and data transfer. 
    AudioToolbox is used to allow for the vibration commands to function


How To:
   use sharedManager: to get the singleton instance of the BTCManager
   call one of the two available configureManagerAs**** methods in order to configure your game or controller. 
        each of those methods comes with a block method which MUST be handled in order for a connection to be established
   you must then call startSession for both the controller and the game. 


keep in mind, you need to create a controller to send the commands, and a server to receive the commands.  You can wrap this all into a single universal app if you would like.  However, i would recommend making a dedicated controller app. 


the BTCManager.h file is fairly well documented.  Please refer to that, and the example projects.
